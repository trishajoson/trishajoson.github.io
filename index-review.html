                    <p>This game is incredible. Valorant has the same great gunplay as CS, but with mechanics that make it so that the game never gets stale. This game succeeds in certain areas that CS did not, and introduces smaller mechanics that CS should've had from the get go, for example, the selling system, requesting system, and the pinging system. The different characters introduce a new level of teamplay, with characters that can use their abilities in ways that synergize with others, allowing for great plays to be made. Another big factor about this game is the fact that it can run on potato pcs. a low end pc can run this game smoothly, with little to no problems appearing. Unlike valve, Riot actually listens to their community, and with every patch the game gets better and better. I personally found CS:GO to get stale after a while, so this game was a breath of fresh air for me and my friends. I totally suggest this game to anyone who is interested. GIVE IT A SHOT!</p>

                    <p>Its fun, feels like a real tactical shooter. Just a few problems that i hope Riot can sort out most noteably the peekers advantage that in this game feels much more present than in CSGO or other shooters and also the hit registry issues. 

                        Hit registry issues and gameplay issues ive encountered:
                        
                        1*Headshot registres as body shots (I am certain this where headshots without a doubt and have video to back it)
                        
                        2*I see the opponents "Marshall" shot go 1.5 meter above my head but i die 1 second later from the same shot due to poor registry and latency.
                        (On my screen the enemy is still moving and it make sense for there shot to not be accurate since he got movement error) 
                        
                        
                        
                        Conclusion glitches that greatly affect gameplay since you don't get the information that is actually happening in the game at all times. 
                        
                        Hard to play competetively therefor. 
                        
                        But i hope Riot will work on fixes for this. <br>

                    <p>I've been playing Valorant since beta now and this game is pretty good, some features are a little too beginner friendly in my opinion (Like being able to easily run and gun with a rifle) but for the most part it is good. 

                        This act I am getting a maximum of +13 rating for a blowout game where I get more then 20 kills. But when I lose a game that is very close, I always get -30 rating. This makes it impossible to climb up ranks. I know about the hidden mmr thing and how "You should be in this rank so we made it harder to climb." good lobby. I would make a new account because that seems to be what everyone is doing but I have a skin on my account which I want to use. 
                        There is some bug as said in many articles in the vanguard,which I hope the RIOT team will solve very soon. Lots of people are having this problem right now whether it be pros like tenz, casual players or lower level players.
                        
                        Also there are a lot of people that leave the game in the middle. 
                        
                        
                        
                        Also I do recommend this game to new gamers because it does not require a good computer and is beginner friendly!</p>

                    <p>Been playing for almost 2 weeks now and can tell I really enjoy playing Valorant.
                        1-Community is much less toxic than League of Legends
                        2-Amazing Graphics
                        3-Game is nowhere near being Pay2play, I haven't spent a single penny on it yet. Unlike CrossFire, Valorant is very free 2 play and buying skins won't give you any kind of advantage in terms of gameplay, maybe just a better looking weapon which won't make you better as a player.
                        4-So far the only client bug I have found is that when I sign out of League of Legends and immediately run Valorant client, it logs me into League for some reason. I have to wait a little bit or close everything related to Riot Client from the Task Manager
                        
                        Few things I haven't really been enjoying so far are the amount of flashes and smokes in the game. In certain maps, it's really unplayable when people just keep flashing and smoking everywhere and I just can't see anyone and get insta one-tapped out of nowhere. Guess I'll learn how to counter that once I get to know more about the game.</p>

                    <p>Played this game because I tested this game, and it's pretty fun, and a competitive game at that. Adapting the CS skills to Valorant really is fun but old habits die hard, as I keep getting yelled to "revive someone" when I don't even know how to resurrect someone in game. While I was playing in my friend's computer (he's really rich because he's like bought everything), some guy told me to swap weapons because he wanted to hold the expensive skinned gun. I agreed and I heard his reaction through the voice chat, thanking me for the exchange. 

                        Overall, fun game. But I now want custom servers that other communities can create and mod their servers and turn the game into a different game like Team Fortress 2 having custom servers, CS:GO, and others as well. If CS:GO but in Slender wasn't terrifying, then this game but with a Slender boss hunting you down while you collect pages will be more terrifying. </p>

                    <p>Valorant can be fun at times, BUT peeker's advantage is high, guns feel uninspiring and downright EASY, maps feel claustrophobic and uninspiring, abilities which are meant to give an edge feel like they ruin the game, stuck between an ability based shooter and an  actual shooter with no identity, terrible anti-cheat (fried my card), and especially BORING to watch. This game does deserve some praise for trying to get the formula down and the developers are improving the game, if not VERY slowly. The cash shop is also broken, as RIOT is expecting $$$ premium tier prices for gun skins (no trading).

                        If you see a review comparing this to CSGO, it's because they were good at CSGO because of the ceiling or they are burned out and needed something new. Just saying. As someone who is burned out on CSGO I enjoyed this game quite a bit in the beta until the honeymoon phase was over and I saw the cracks.
