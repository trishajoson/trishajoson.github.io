            <h1>Valorant Maps</h1>
            <p>Each match of VALORANT takes place on a map. Maps feature a spawn area for each team, barriers that limit accessible areas during the Buy Phase, and objective sites where the spike is to be planted.
                Four maps were available at launch, and a six-month cycle is expected for the release of new maps.There are currently nine playable maps in VALORANT, with an additional one for practice and training new players.</p>

                    <h5>Breeze's 'unique' features are present on the A side of the map, mostly to do with A Hall. There are ropes to get players into A Hall. On the defending side players can use the rope at the back of A Site to get onto Bridge and into Hall, and on the attacking side players can use the rope in A Lobby to get into Hall.
    
                        A Site has an impenetrable, indestructible mechanical door leading into A Hall that can be opened and closed using switches on either side. The door is closed at the start of each round.
                        
                        Towards the Attacker side of Hall is a one-way chute (also known as a 'vent') that can be used to go to Mid.</h5>

                        -Four that allow players to navigate through Vents.<br>

                        Split updates:<br>
                        1)A Main - Added a small ledge and widened the area for attackers.<br>
                        2)A Main Box - Boost box reduced.<br>
                        3)A Rafters - Under-over area removed.<br>
                        4)A Tower - Back section of Tower flattened and changed position of stairs.<br>
                        5)Mid Bottom - Adds a small platform that allows players to silently drop down<br>
                        6)B Tower - Simplified the jump up box.<br>
                        7)B Rope Pocket - Smoothed out the hard corner to make clearing the spot easier.<br></h5>

                    <h5>Ascent is a map set in Italy that features a large, open middle area that both teams can skirmish over. Mid is a playground for diverse ability use and successfully controlling the area opens additional routes for Attackers to both Spike sites.

                        The map's 'unique' features include mechanical doors leading into sites. Each site has one door (A Link for A and Market for B) that is opened at the start of each round. Players can use a switch on the site side of the door (Next to the door on A and on a table in Toolshed on B) to close or open the door. These doors are impenetrable while closed but have 500 HP, allowing players to damage and eventually destroy them. Once destroyed, the doorway remains permanently open for the rest of the round.
                        
                        The two walls separating Courtyard from Link also have a destructible panel each to cover them. Whilst intact, they absorb damage and cannot be penetrated by gunfire. The panels however have 400 HP each and can be damaged, with colored indicators on them implying how much health they have left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as they take more damage). They can eventually be destroyed to allow players to wallbang through these walls for the rest of the round.
